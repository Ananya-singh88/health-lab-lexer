# BioBERT Fine-Tuning Guide

This guide explains how to fine-tune the Bio_ClinicalBERT model on custom medical data to improve its performance for medical text analysis.

## Overview

Fine-tuning the Bio_ClinicalBERT model allows it to better understand specific medical terminology and contexts in your data. This implementation uses Masked Language Modeling (MLM) to fine-tune the model on your custom medical text data.

## Requirements

Make sure you have the following packages installed:

```bash
pip install transformers datasets torch accelerate
```

## Data Format

Your training data should be in JSON format with the following structure:

```json
[
  {
    "text": "Patient's lab results show glucose: 120 mg/dL, cholesterol: 190 mg/dL..."
  },
  {
    "text": "The patient has a history of type 2 diabetes mellitus with an A1C of 7.8%..."
  },
  ...
]
```
